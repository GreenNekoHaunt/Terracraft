1. Copyright
----------

### 1.1 General ###
The Game ("Minecraft") itself belongs to Mojang so their copyright applies to it. The ideas used in this mod belong to
the creators of Terraria. The code itself belongs to the currently only developer GreenNekoHaunt if not mentioned
differently in the files header. All graphics are self-made and not copied from Terraria nor re-drawn the exact same way
(also colors may differ from slightly to heavily).

### 1.2 Source Code ###
You are freely allowed to use this source code as help for your own modification of Minecraft. However you should not
copy large snippets from this source. Especially if you claim them as yours.

### 1.3 Graphics ###
The graphics from this modification can be further used under the agreement of mentioning the creator or designer and
only if they are not modified. This counts for all graphics of all versions of Terracraft.

2. Collaborating
----------
Terracraft is not an open source project. The reason for this is simple. The goal is to create a Terraria in Minecraft
by applying all the Terraria features while keeping adaptions at bay. This basically means that the number of Terraria
features which are adapted is kept very low.

### 2.1 Applying ###
Anyone who understands enough of the Minecraft source code and java to work with it on an advanced level is welcome in
the team. To join the team you actually only need to send an e-mail to "neubert.pascal@yahoo.de". The e-mail must
include your username (obviously), one or several technical reasons why you want to apply, a code snippet from a mod you
made for fun or even released.

### 2.2 Adapting Features ###
At Terracraft there is a special workflow on how to adapt a feature of Terraria to Minecraft. It starts with bringing
the idea to the whole team naming a reason why you want to adapt it and how the adaption gives a benefit. Followed by
them all deciding for whether or not there is a possibility to include this feature without adapting. If the feature
actually can't be done or would make a huge difference from the Minecraft system (e.g. Terraria slimes not being like
squares) the priority of this feature is checked. If the priority is not high enough the feature will be pushed to a
later release where the feature might be possible to an update of Minecraft or forge. However if the priority is higher
the team thinking about an appropriate way to adapt the feature. For example the crafting System in Terraria can be
adopted to Minecraft as the world isn't that rich from Terracraft ores and the Minecraft System is much easier and
more comfortable for the user to easily memorize. The team then approves of the adapted feature or searches for a better
to adapt the feature.

### 2.3 Code Tidiness ###
Currently I'm tinkering alone. Once the team increases in size I'm also going to tidy up the source code including lots
of comments and documentation for anyone to understand. I also advise every other team member to document their code
before uploading.

3. Adapted Features
----------

*.  Feature: Alternate Ores spawn chunk based instead of world based.<br/>
    Reason: Terraria map is restricted, Minecraft world is infinite. Characters from Minecraft are world dependend.<br/>
*.  Feature: Minecrafts crafting system will be used for Terracraft recipes.<br/>
    Reason: Minecrafts crafting system is more comfortable and can be easily memorized unlike Terraria's.<br/>
